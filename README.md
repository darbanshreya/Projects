# Design2Wear-AI 👗🤖

**AI-Powered Fashion Recommendation System** built with Python, TensorFlow, Keras, and scikit-learn.

> Content-based recommendation engine that matches user preferences (color, style, occasion, season, fabric, size, gender, skin tone) against 44,000+ real fashion products using cosine similarity and neural networks.

## Demo

### Streamlit Web App (Full 44K Dataset)
The live app searches all 44,424 products with real images, gender filtering, and color-aware matching.

**To run locally:**
```bash
pip install streamlit
streamlit run app.py
```

## ML Lifecycle

This project follows the complete ML lifecycle:

```
Data Collection → Data Cleaning → Feature Engineering → Model Training → Evaluation → Deployment → Monitoring
```

### 1. Data Collection
- **Source:** [Kaggle Fashion Product Images](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paramaggarwal/fashion-product-images-small) (44,424 products)
- **Augmented with:** occasion, fabric, style, skin_tone, size (rule-based domain knowledge mapping)
- **User ratings:** 9,000 synthetic ratings from 300 simulated users

### 2. Data Cleaning
- Handled missing values (mode/median imputation)
- Removed duplicates
- Standardized text (lowercase, stripped whitespace)
- Added 5 missing columns using domain-knowledge mapping

### 3. Feature Engineering
- **One-Hot Encoding** (scikit-learn) — 15 categorical columns → 208 binary features
- **70% / 10% / 20% split** — Training / Validation / Test (explicit, not random)
- **StandardScaler** — Normalized features for neural network

### 4. Model Training (3 Iterations)

| Version | Architecture | Regularization | MAE | MSE | R² |
|---------|-------------|----------------|-----|-----|-----|
| V1 Basic | 32→16 neurons | None | 0.566 | 0.519 | -0.640 |
| V2 Deeper | 128→64→32 + Dropout | Dropout 0.3/0.2 | 0.530 | 0.676 | -1.139 |
| **V3 Full** | **128→64→32→16 + BatchNorm** | **Dropout + EarlyStopping** | **0.470** | **0.357** | **-0.130** |

**Key insight:** V1 severely overfitted (train loss → 0.02, val → 0.60). V2 added dropout but trained too long. V3's EarlyStopping automatically stopped at epoch 47 with BatchNormalization keeping training stable.

### 5. Evaluation
- Best model (V3): MAE = 0.47 on held-out test set
- Predictions off by less than half a rating point on 1-5 scale
- Learning curves confirm V3 has best generalization (train/val loss stay close)

### 6. Deployment
- **Cosine Similarity Engine** — Encodes user preferences into vectors, computes similarity against all 44K products
- **Gender Hard Filter** — Wrong gender products are completely removed before scoring
- **Deduplication** — Ensures varied recommendations (no 8 identical blue shirts)
- **Streamlit Web App** — Full interactive UI with real product images

### 7. Monitoring
- Performance tracking dashboard
- Iteration history showing progressive improvement
- Recommended monthly retraining with new user feedback

## Key Interview Talking Points

1. **"Used 44K real fashion products from Kaggle, augmented with domain knowledge"**
2. **"70/10/20 explicit split — training, validation, and test sets"**
3. **"3 iterative model versions showing progressive improvement"**
4. **"Cosine similarity + neural network for hybrid recommendations"**
5. **"Full lifecycle: collection → cleaning → engineering → training → evaluation → deployment → monitoring"**

---

## Future Improvements

- **Embeddings** instead of one-hot encoding (captures relationships like "casual" being closer to "smart casual" than "formal")
- **Feedback loop** where user ratings retrain the model over time
- **RAG integration** to incorporate fashion trend knowledge
- **Image-based similarity** using CNN features from product photos
